# This is a heading (h1)

## This is a smaller heading (h2)

### This is a h3

#### be sure to add a space after the # for compatibility (h4)

##### h5 we can use Ctrl-Shift-V to view this markdown

###### H6 add line breaks after your headings (h6)

I am a paragraph do not indent me. Just write here to start writing on a new line. Add trailing-white space aka three now I am on a new line

or we can leave a full space between lines to start a new paragraph or we can use HTML in markdown and use the '<br>' tag

You can write in **bold** or in *italics* or ***both at the came time***

    We can even put out text in boxes using a tab

## Lists

We can make ordered lists:
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

The numbering does not matter as long as you start with number 1

1. item 1
1. item 2
1. item 3
2. item 4
7. item 5

We can also make unordered lists:
- first item
- second item
- third item

## HR

We can make a horizontal rule

## Links

We can add links [My Link](http://www.google.com)

## Images

We can add images ![my image stolen from google](https://i.chzbgr.com/thumb800/2451461/hC8A4840A/seventeen-very-funny-memes-for-today)


## Code Block

We can add a line of code \`

`
<a href="funnystuff.com"><img src="funnyimage.png"></a>
`
We can also add code block with \`\`\`
````
    def my_function(name):
        return f"Hello{name}"

## More Information

There are a lot of different flavors of markdown out there for instance Github has its own flavor. These commands should be universal though to all markdown languages.

There are more options you can learn like embedding these elements inside eachother, making footnotes, task lists,
definitions list etc. If you want to learn more visit:
[Markdow Home Page](https://www.markdownguide.org)

There is also an extended syntac that is available in mary markdown applications that I have not shown here. You can learn more at the Markdown homepage
